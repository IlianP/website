intro: Currently, I work on the AI-powered social media monitoring tool [Cosmention](https://cosmention.com). It's a fully automated data pipeline for collecting social media posts, analyzing them with spaCy and presenting the latest trends in an R Shiny app. I'm the inventor and lead developer of the tool, which is in use at Europe's largest drugstore chain dm.
