Product life-cycles in markets for innovative products are shortening, con- sumers rapidly upgrade from one product generation to the next and demand constant technical improvement. Firms are racing against each other and the consumers’ rising ex- pectations. This study uses an agent-based simulation model to analyze the dynamics of innovation and imitation strategies in this new type of market from the firm perspective. Firms use pure and mixed strategies to achieve maximum profitability over the life-cycle of a market for a new product category. It is found that strategies involving innovation outperform those that rely only on imitation, even in absence of any protective measures like patenting or branding.
