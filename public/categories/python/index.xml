      <description>An AI-powered social media monitoring tool for the cosmetics industry. A fully automated data pipeline starting from social media APIs and ending in a customizable dashboard.
I am the inventor and lead developer and started the project as an independent SaaS offering. It was acquired by Q Insight Agency and is now in use at dm, the largest drug store chain in Europe.
I presented the data pipeline in 2021 at the BVM (German association of social and market researchers) symposium on artificial intelligence and wrote an article on Marktforschung.</description>
