      <description>I’m a long time R user and lately I’ve seen more and more signals that it’s worth investing into learning more Python. I use it for NLP with spaCy and to build functions on AWS Lambda (though the recent lambdr package gave R some great tools there too). Further, there are many more data acquisition libaries available for Python than for R.

All you need to activate the form is a valid recipient email address saved in the front matter of the form (/content/forms/contact.md). Of course, the example shown below (your@email.here) must not be used.</description>
