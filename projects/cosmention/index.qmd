I am the inventor and lead developer and started the project as an independent SaaS offering. It was acquired by [Q Insight Agency](https://teamq.de) and is now in use at [dm](https://dm.de), the largest drug store chain in Europe.

I presented the data pipeline in 2021 at the BVM (German association of social and market researchers) [symposium on artificial intelligence](/talk/bvmki2021) and wrote an [article](https://www.marktforschung.de/dossiers/themendossiers/kuenstliche-intelligenz-in-marktanalyse-kundenmanagement-und-darueber-hinaus/dossier/marktforschung-als-data-pipeline-datenfluesse-kontinuierlich-analysieren/) on Marktforschung.de, the largest German market research website.

Tech stack: R, Shiny, spaCy (Python), AWS, Docker, Postgres, Snowflake
