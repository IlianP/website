Hi! I'm Paul Simmering, a data scientist from Germany specializing in Natural Language Processing. Besides coding, I enjoy writing and speaking about data science.

I’m the inventor and lead developer of [Cosmention](https://cosmention.com), an AI-powered social media monitoring tool for cosmetics. It’s a fully automated data pipeline for collecting social media posts, analyzing them with ML and reporting via dashboard and email. It’s in use at Europe’s largest drugstore chain dm.

The best way to contact me is via email: [paul.simmering@gmail.com](mailto:paul.simmering@gmail.com).

This website is built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org). The source is available on [Github](https://github.com/psimm/website).
