[The Grug Brained Developer](https://grugbrain.dev) is a humorous essay on software development best practices. I enjoyed reading it and the lessons resonated with me. I thought I would share my own version, geared towards data professionals.

## Introduction

this collection of thoughts on data science gathered by grug brain data scientist. good for young grugs that liked The Grug Brained Developer and now want more into data

grug data scientist not understand all but try many thing and fail and learn and do better over time and share what not awful

## Complexity bad in data science too

data science field much complex. many thing can go wrong and often invisible to grug

complexity is bad because it makes grugs brain hurt and causes many mistakes that come back to bite grug later

big brain data scientists always make new way to make more complex

- always new pipeline tools
- always new big brain models
- always new things to put in cloud
- always new way to bring data to business shamans

every day new shiny things to learn that promise make life better and less complexity but really often make more complexity. many duds but also many gems!

## Data problem needs data solution

many data methods use complex methods to fix problem that is actually in data

for example, many data scientist use complex methods to fix problem of missing data. but often better to fix problem of missing data at source

if data is bad, fix data

say again: *if data is bad, fix data*

fix data often requires talking to other groups and business shamans and waiting. but must endure and fix data. tempting to just use code to fix but this often bad idea

## Data quality

data quality most important. if data bad, model bad. if model bad, prediction bad. if prediction bad, business bad, so no shiny rocks for grug

bad data is demon of data sciencing. it is sneaky demon that hides in data and makes grug look bad or worse, give bad info to business shamans. many shiny rocks lost to bad data

grug likes being close to data. but big brain data tools often hide data and make it hard for grug to look at tables. grug like to look at tables. grug often finds problems in data by looking at tables

grug work in data warehouse many years and when grug smells a stink, grug look at tables and find problem. when grug ignores stink and doesn't look at tables, grug always regrets it later

but projects often have many tables and grug busy. so grug must automate looking at tables

so grug uses data quality frameworks to check if data is missing, is in wrong format, or is out of range and if foreign keys are valid

best guarantee comes from enforced constraints in database. constraints always vigilant and never allow dirty data. Constraints always on guard and never sleep

but analytics databases are too lazy to enforce constraints. so grug must use data quality frameworks to check data. grug not like this but best grug can do

## Counting things

grug like to count things. when data quality is nice, often counting things already good enough to make business shamans happy. grug can count anything: users, orders, clicks, shiny rocks collected and more. grug can also separate counting by time, location, and other things

counting is easy to do and fit into grug's brain and business shaman's brain. 
grug can also make pretty pictures of counts

## Visualization

bar chart is grug's best friend forever. grug can make bar chart of anything. easy for business shamans and grug to understand.

complex chart like network graph or tree map or radar chart often too hard to understand. message get lost in complexity.

pie chart and word cloud look easy but often cause misunderstanding. almost always better to use bar chart. sometimes business shamans ask for pie chart, and when chart has few slices, it's ok. but when chart has many slices, grug must say no.

## Machine learning

machine learning is powerful tool and unlocker of many shiny rocks. grug also understands that is not magic and not always best tool for job

many big brain data scientists use complex machine learning models to solve problem that can be solved with simple model. maybe big brain data scientists like to show off big brain

this very bad because big model cost many shiny rocks to train and many shiny rocks to run. grug can't look into big model to see what it is doing and grug can't explain big model to business shamans. grug also can't explain big model to grug's self. grug prefer simple model that fits in grug's brain

some hard problems can only be solved with a big model. then grug must use big model

with any models, grug likes reproducible model training and evaluation. grug and colleagues often need to retrain models and compare. easy to forget settings and which data was used. better to have tool that logs everything

last few years many big model change grug's life. grug can now do things that grug could not do before. big brain data scientists work very fast to make big model better and better. grug very happy about this and grug hope big brain data scientists keep doing this

grug prepares for new big model to change. grug knows: model come and go. model is not forever and new model will come and make old model look bad

## Performance and productivity

when grug has to wait for model to train or database to query, grug gets bored and grug's brain wanders. that's bad for grug's productivity. makes business shamans become impatient too

data exploration and model experimentation is more fun when machine goes brrrr rather than when machine goes zzzzz. so when something slows down grug, grug uses performance profiling tools to find problem and fix it

caching best friend of grug. grug often ask for same thing many times. indexing also good friend

development in cloud twisted concept. cloud scales in production - nice! but bad for developer experience. write code on laptop, package, upload, and wait for cloud to run. very slow and often tiny bug that grug could fix in 1 minute takes 30 minutes to fix. grug look for ways to develop locally or with quick feedback loop. setup often can be headache but so worth it!

## Expanding the grug brain

grug's brain too small and grug too busy to keep up with all new shiny toys. grug must choose which shiny toys to learn

popular shamans have new toys every day and promise that new toys will solve all problems. grug not always believe this. but grug has also seen that some new toys are the real deal and actually do make life better. so grug must choose wisely

learn evergreen skills is always good idea. grug loves SQL because SQL was good for shiny rock collection for decades and will be good for shiny rock collection for decades more. many new toys use SQL so grug can use SQL with new toys

grug aspires to have brain shaped like letter T. grug wants to know basics of many things and aspires to big brain in one thing

always need data quality and visualization and model evaluation. these are basic demon defense skills that every grug must have. cloud also good

to get more shiny rocks, grug must be extra good at one more thing, like model sorcery or huge data organization or business shaman rituals

some developers identify themselves by their tools. grug is wary of this. grug is data scientist, not Spark data scientist or Snowflake data scientist or AWS data scientist. when grug find new shiny rock mine, grug will use tool that other grugs use at shiny rock mine

## Conclusion

good data better than complex pipeline
